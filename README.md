Hi, I am a scientist focuses on quantum computing. 
My research focuses on the theoretical foundations and practical applications of quantum information science, particularly at the intersection of quantum and classical computing. I am interested in research directions related to:

Quantum algorithms and information theory: Adaptive variational approaches (ADAPT-QAOA), Physics-informed quantum optimization, Hardware-algorithm co-design, Quantum resource allocation strategies, Theoretical models for quantum advantage, Mathematical frameworks for error correction, Information-theoretic measurement bounds, Shortcuts to adiabaticity in quantum computation, Entanglement management in quantum circuits;

Hybrid quantum-classical systems: Reinforcement learning for quantum resources, Gradient-free quantum optimization, Quantum machine learning for scientific applications, Efficient quantum-classical interfaces, Gibbs state preparation methods.

Through this interdisciplinary approach, I aim to bridge theoretical quantum advantages with practical implementations on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.
