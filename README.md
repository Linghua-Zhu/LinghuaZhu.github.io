Hi, I am a scientist focuses on quantum computing. 
My research focuses on the intersection of quantum and classical computing architectures, targeting optimization across the full computing stack. I explore:

Quantum Computing: Application-tailored full-stack optimization, variational quantum algorithms with emphasis on hardware-algorithm co-design, and custom error mitigation techniques. My work extends to hybrid quantum-classical systems, quantum error correction decoders, classical simulation approaches, pulse-level optimization, and efficient resource management for quantum cloud environments.

Computational Infrastructure: I leverage machine learning for intelligent system optimization and focus on accelerating computational approaches for scientific applications, with particular attention to quantum-classical integration challenges.

Through this interdisciplinary approach, I aim to bridge theoretical quantum advantages with practical implementations on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.
